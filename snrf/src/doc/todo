[ receiver lost bytes ]

data must be capture asap in the interrupt handler
 -> both for uart and nrf, but do first for uart
they must be handled afterward
if an overflow occurs, because the buffer is filled
too fast for the soft to process it, then introduce
a missed byte flag and possibly alert the host

loosing uart bytes is especially likely when nrf data
are received in burst from the nrf, as interrupt are
-> mask interrupt consistently using the interrupt
mask


[ invalid bytes ]

use a 8/16 bits CRC to detect invalid frame. maintain
a counter and send alert to host.
