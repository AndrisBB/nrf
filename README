NORDIC radio frequency core repository, plus unit testing
programs. For now, only nr24l01p supported (maybe nrf2401a).

src: source common to all projects (nrfxxx.c, spi, uart)
snrf: serial to nrf
unit/bw: bandwidth related tests
unit/range: used to test the emission / reception range
unit/simple: do not remember, but must be something simple
